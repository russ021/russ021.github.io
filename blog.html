                    1. Clone a remote repo.<br>
                    2. Make some local changes.<br>
                    3. Add those changes.<br>
                    4. Commit changes.<br>
                    5. Pull then push to the remote.<br>

                    <p>Origin is an alias for the remote repo. You can review your changes using<br>
                    $ git diff or $ git diff --staged. Use<br>
                    $ git restore or $ git restore --staged filename to restore a file.<br>
                    To view commit history use<br>
                    $ git log. The most recent is at the top of the list. HEAD is the default reference to the branch you're working on.<br>
                    When HEAD is no longer on the branch your working on it is known as detached. To reattach just use<br>

                    $ git config --global pull.rebase false.

                    Untracked, Unmodified, Modified, and Staged. here are some ways to change the states a file is in.<br>
                    Untracked - git add foo.txt - Staged(as "new file")<br>
                    Modified - git add foo.txt - Staged<br>
                    Modified - git restore foo.txt - Unmodified<br>
                    Unmodified - edit foo.txt - Modified(with your favourite editor)<br>
                    Staged - git commit - Unmodified<br>
                    Staged - git restore --staged - Modified<br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><h1>To find out the difference of modified file use:</h1>
                    $ git diff filename<br>
                    diff rules:<br>
                    If a line is prefixed with -, it means this is how the line was in the old version.<br>
                    If a line is prefixed with +, It means this is how the line is in the new, modified version.<br>
                    If a line is not prefixed with anything, it means it is unchanged between the versions.<br>
                    If you just want a list of files that have changed, you can use the --name-only option.<br>
                    To see what the diff between fileone and filetwo are use<br>
                    $ git diff fileone...filetwo<br>
                    </p>
                    
                <p>Never rebase anything that you have pushed unless you know what your doing. Run<br>
                    $ git rebase --continue until all commits have been rebased cleanly. You can use git stash if you want to return your working tree<br>
                    to the state of the last commit. Once your done and want to get back to were you left off use git stash pop.<br> 
                    $ git stash pushes the working tree on the stash stack.<br>
                    $ git stash drop deletes a particular stash stack entry.<br>
                    $ git stash list shows you the current stash stack.<br>
                    $ git stash drop deletes a particular stash stack entry.<br>
                    
                    It is a good idea to keep in sync with the upstream repo. Once you have the upstream remote set up, you have to sync running<br>
                    $ git fetch upstream<br>
                    then merge or rebase. You can use<br>
                    $ git reflog to get back to a commit you deleted.<br>
                </p>
                    <p><h1>Some common variable settings:</h1>
                        1.  user.name                         Your name<br>

                    </p>
                    
                    <p><h1>Using a repo with submodules:</h1>
