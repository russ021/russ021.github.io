               - Run your scripts in parts to identify errors.
               - Use set -x to trace command execution and identify issues.
               
               <p>#!/bin/bash<br>

               set -x  # Enable command tracing<br>
               
               greeting="Hello, World!"<br>
               echo $greeting<br>
               
               nonexistent_command  # Intentional error<br>
               echo "This won't run if the script exits on error."</p>
